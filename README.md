I am using this repo as I follow along with Hadoop The Definitive Guide by Tom White.

Some of the code will be copied directly from the book and when it is I will be sure to note it in the comments.

This project will also include attempts of my own at writing Hadoop Jobs as well as attempted modifications to Mr. White's code.
